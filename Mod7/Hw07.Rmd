#### 1.

(a) Fit a simple model using just education, catholic and infant.morality

```{r}
result<- lm(Fertility~., data=data)
summary(result)
```

```{r}
simple.result<-lm(Fertility~Education+Catholic+Infant.Mortality, data=data)
anova(simple.result)
```

Based on the findings of this comparison, it would suggest that in this model these coefficients all have a significant test statistic as well as a significant P-value. and a highly significant p-value for the model as a whole

```{r}
summary(simple.result)
```

```{r}
anova(simple.result, result)
```

Null Hypothesis: At least one of the coefficients from the full model is 0

Alternate: none of these values are 1

```{r}

```
